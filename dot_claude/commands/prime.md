# Input
$ARGUMENTS

## Project Context Setup
Please analyze the current project and provide:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Primary programming language(s) detected
   - Framework/libraries in use
   - Project structure and architecture pattern
   - Estimated codebase size and complexity

2. **Development Environment**
   - Build system and dependencies
   - Test framework(s) present
   - Configuration files found
   - Development scripts available

## Capability Verification
Demonstrate your understanding by:

1. **Code Comprehension Test**
   - Find and explain the main entry point
   - Identify the core business logic location
   - Describe the data flow for one key feature
   - List any design patterns you recognize

2. **Technical Stack Familiarity**
   - Rate your familiarity (1-10) with each technology found
   - Highlight any libraries/frameworks where you're particularly strong
   - Note any technologies where you might have limitations

## Working Style Calibration

1. **Code Style Analysis**
   - Identify the coding conventions used
   - Note any linting/formatting rules detected
   - Describe the commenting/documentation style
   - Recognize naming conventions

2. **Testing Patterns**
   - Describe the testing approach used
   - Identify test file naming conventions
   - Note coverage tools if present
   - Understand assertion/mocking patterns

## Communication Preferences

1. **How should I interact with you?**
   - Preferred level of detail in explanations
   - Should I ask for clarification or make reasonable assumptions?
   - How should I handle ambiguous requirements?
   - Should I proactively suggest improvements?

2. **Output Preferences**
   - Code comment density preference
   - Documentation style (inline vs separate)
   - Error handling verbosity
   - Logging/debugging code inclusion

## Current State Assessment

1. **Quick Health Check**
   - Any obvious bugs or issues spotted?
   - Critical files that seem problematic?
   - Missing essential components?
   - Security concerns noticed?

2. **Improvement Opportunities**
   - Top 3 quick wins you notice
   - Any architectural concerns
   - Performance bottlenecks visible
   - Technical debt indicators

## Session Goals & Constraints

1. **What are we focusing on today?**
   - Feature development
   - Bug fixing
   - Refactoring
   - Testing
   - Documentation

2. **Any specific constraints?**
   - Time limitations
   - Code freeze areas
   - Dependencies to avoid
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations

## Collaboration Agreement

1. **Working Patterns**
   - Should I implement and test in one go?
   - Preference for incremental vs complete solutions?
   - How to handle breaking changes?
   - Approach to backwards compatibility?

2. **Quality Standards**
   - Definition of "done" for tasks
   - Required test coverage
   - Documentation requirements
   - Code review checklist items

## Ready Check
After analyzing the above:
1. Summarize your understanding in 3-4 sentences
2. List any tools/files you'll need to reference frequently
3. Confirm any assumptions you're making
4. Ask any clarifying questions before we begin
